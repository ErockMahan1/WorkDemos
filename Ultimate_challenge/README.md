# Ultimate Challenge – Springboard Project

## Overview

The Ultimate Challenge is a capstone-style data science project focused on analyzing and modeling user retention and ride activity for a fictional ride-sharing company. Conducted in a Jupyter notebook, it walks through the full data science workflow, simulating a real-world business analytics scenario.

## Concepts Explored

* **Business Problem Framing:**
  Defined objectives to identify key predictors of user retention and ride frequency, aiming to enhance engagement and long-term customer value.

* **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
  Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user demographics, ride behavior, and product usage. Cleaned and integrated multiple datasets while handling missing data and inconsistencies.

* **Feature Engineering:**
  Crafted new features capturing user lifecycle stages, engagement patterns, and preferences. Leveraged business understanding to design variables that improve predictive power.

* **Predictive Modeling:**
  Developed classification models—including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods—to predict retention and high ride frequency. Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

* **Interpretation and Recommendations:**
  Analyzed model outputs to pinpoint influential factors driving retention and ride activity. Formulated actionable business recommendations to boost user engagement and retention.

## Lessons Learned

* A structured, end-to-end data science workflow—from problem framing to actionable insights—ensures relevance and impact.
* Thoughtful feature engineering, rooted in domain knowledge, often outweighs the choice of model for improving predictive accuracy.
* Evaluating models with multiple metrics provides a comprehensive view, especially when dealing with imbalanced or complex data.
* Translating data findings into clear business strategies is essential for realizing data science value.
* Tackling open-ended, real-world challenges develops both technical expertise and strategic thinking needed in industry.

## Conclusion

This project gave hands-on experience with the full lifecycle of a business-focused data science challenge. Through user retention and ride activity analysis, I honed skills in data wrangling, feature creation, predictive modeling, and delivering actionable recommendations—core competencies for a data science professional.
