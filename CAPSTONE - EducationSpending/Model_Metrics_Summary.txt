Model Metrics Summary: Graduation Rate Forecasting & Spending Analysis
=====================================================================

Models Used
----------
- Random Forest Regressor (or insert specific model used), Linear Regression, ARIMA, ETS, Tableau Forecast
- Target Variables: Graduation Rate (%), Spending
- Features: State, Year, Education Spending, Graduation Rate


Prediction Performance
----------------------
**Measuring spending against graduation rate**
Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.02823
Pearson r: 0.0282320519487733
p-value: (rounded to 5 decimal places)  (0.00005)


**Measuring spending against ACT score**
ACT Score = 0.0002 * Spending + 18.1713
R^2: 0.3052


**Measuring spending against old SAT scores**
SATo Score = -0.0041 * Spending + 856.5526
R^2: 0.0016


**Measuring spending against new SAT scores **
SATn Score = -0.0040 * Spending + 813.6533
R^2: 0.0048



Correlation Analysis
--------------------
- Spending vs. Graduation Rate:
Increased spending does NOT consistently lead to increased graduation rates, nor does reduced spending always correlate with decreased performance.


-Spending vs. ACT Score:
There is a moderate positive relationship between spending and ACT scores. About 30.5% of the variance in ACT scores can be explained by spending, suggesting some practical association.


-Spending vs. old SAT Score:
There is virtually no relationship between spending and old SAT scores. Spending explains less than 0.2% of the variance in scores.


-Spending vs new SAT Score:
There is no meaningful relationship between spending and new SAT scores. Spending explains only 0.5% of the variance in scores.



Notable Observations
--------------------
- Vermont had one of the highest increases in spending but experienced the largest drop in graduation rate.
- Wyoming had the biggest spending cut but still saw a modest increase in graduation rate.
- Some states saw improved graduation outcomes despite minimal spending changes, suggesting other factors are responsible for these changes
- Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SATs) have shown progressively lower results despite increases in spending in secondary education
- Lowest and Highest states in terms of predicted graduation rates score almost identically on nationwide standardized tests


Visualization Summary
---------------------
- Line plots showed trends in spending and graduation rates from 2011–2018.
- Percent change plots highlighted volatility in both spending and performance.
- Color-coded bar charts visualized:
  - Spending change (green = increase, red = decrease)
  - Graduation rate change (position on axis = change; color = spending context)
- Plot of Standardized Tests show downward trend


Forecasting
-----------
- Graduation rates were predicted for years beyond the dataset (e.g., 2019–2021).
- Visual comparison of actual vs. predicted performance for individual states showed:
  - Reasonably close alignment for many states
  - Some divergence where model underestimated or overestimated the true values
- SAT scores were predicted for the next 10 years, showing an increasing decline in average score rate


Next Steps
----------
- Incorporate additional features (economic indicators, alternative secondary education, cultural attitudes toward education)
- Compare state-specific models of secondary education spending
- Evaluate spending and academic achievement at 8th-Grade level
