# Clustering Case Study – Customer Segmentation with K-Means

## Overview

This project applies K-Means clustering to perform customer segmentation, a key technique in unsupervised machine learning for discovering distinct groups within a customer base. The analysis, conducted in a Jupyter notebook, demonstrates the full workflow of clustering, from data preparation and feature scaling to cluster evaluation and interpretation[1][4][6].

## Concepts Explored

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Examined distributions and relationships among customer features to understand the dataset’s structure and identify patterns relevant for segmentation[4][6].

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Scaled features to ensure equal weighting in the clustering process, an essential step for distance-based algorithms like K-Means[4][6].
  - Transformed categorical variables as needed for inclusion in the model.

- **K-Means Clustering:**
  - Applied the K-Means algorithm to group customers into clusters based on feature similarity[1][6][9][10].
  - Used methods such as the elbow method and silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters for the data[4][6][11].
  - Iteratively refined clusters to achieve meaningful segmentation.

- **Cluster Interpretation and Visualization:**
  - Interpreted cluster centroids by examining average feature values within each group.
  - Visualized clusters using scatter plots and other graphical tools to aid understanding and communication of results[4][6][11].

- **Actionable Insights:**
  - Provided recommendations for how marketing and business strategies can be tailored to each customer segment, such as targeted promotions or personalized product offerings[4][6][8].

## Lessons Learned

- **Importance of Preprocessing:**  
  Proper scaling and transformation of features are crucial for effective clustering, as K-Means is sensitive to differences in feature magnitude[4][6].

- **Cluster Validation:**  
  Techniques like the silhouette score and elbow method are valuable for assessing the quality and appropriateness of the chosen number of clusters[4][6][11].

- **Interpretability:**  
  Analyzing the characteristics of each cluster helps translate technical results into actionable business insights, supporting data-driven decision-making[4][6][8].

- **Business Application:**  
  Customer segmentation enables organizations to better understand their clientele, personalize marketing, and improve customer satisfaction and retention[4][6][8].

- **Limitations and Extensions:**  
  K-Means assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized; alternative algorithms or additional features (such as purchase history or demographics) could further enhance segmentation results[4][6][9].

## Conclusion

This case study provided practical experience with K-Means clustering for customer segmentation, covering the complete workflow from data preparation to actionable insights. The project reinforced the importance of careful preprocessing, cluster validation, and the translation of technical findings into business value[1][4][6].
