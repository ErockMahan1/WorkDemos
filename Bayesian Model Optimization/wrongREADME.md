# Grid Search KNN Case Study

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to optimize a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using grid search with cross-validation. Conducted in a Jupyter notebook, the case study walks through the process of hyperparameter tuning to identify the best-performing KNN model for a given dataset[1].

## Concepts Explored

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm:**  
  - KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
  - The algorithm predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in feature space[6].

- **Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search:**  
  - Grid search systematically explores combinations of hyperparameters (such as the number of neighbors, distance metric, and weighting scheme) to find the optimal settings for model performance[5][6][7].
  - Used `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn to automate the process, evaluating each parameter combination using cross-validation to avoid overfitting[5][7].

- **Cross-Validation:**  
  - Applied k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance on different subsets of the data, ensuring robust and generalizable results[5][7].

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - Evaluated the tuned KNN model using accuracy and other classification metrics.
  - Analyzed the impact of different hyperparameter choices on model performance.

## Lessons Learned

- **Importance of Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  The choice of k (number of neighbors), distance metric, and weighting can significantly affect KNN performance. Grid search provides a structured way to identify the best combination for the data[5][6][7].

- **Cross-Validation for Robustness:**  
  Using cross-validation during grid search helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the selected model generalizes well to new data[5][7].

- **Model Interpretability:**  
  KNN is easy to understand and interpret, but model performance depends heavily on proper scaling and hyperparameter selection.

- **Computational Considerations:**  
  Grid search can be computationally intensive, especially with large parameter grids or datasets. Efficient parameter selection and parallel processing can help manage runtime[6][7].

## Conclusion

This case study provided hands-on experience with model optimization for KNN using grid search and cross-validation. By systematically tuning hyperparameters, I learned how to maximize classifier performance and ensure robust, generalizable results. The skills developed here are broadly applicable to other machine learning algorithms and real-world data science projects[1][5][6][7].
