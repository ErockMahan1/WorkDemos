# SQL Mini Project

## Overview

This project is a hands-on mini case study designed to build and demonstrate practical skills in SQL (Structured Query Language) for data analysis. Conducted in a Jupyter notebook, the project walks through querying, manipulating, and analyzing data stored in a relational database, simulating real-world data extraction and reporting tasks.

## Concepts Explored

- **SQL Fundamentals:**  
  - Practiced writing basic SQL queries to select, filter, and sort data from tables.
  - Used SQL clauses such as `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` to extract relevant information.

- **Data Aggregation and Grouping:**  
  - Applied aggregation functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`) to summarize data and generate useful statistics.
  - Used `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses to analyze data by categories and filter aggregated results.

- **Joins and Data Relationships:**  
  - Demonstrated how to combine data from multiple tables using different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.).
  - Explored relationships between tables to answer more complex business questions.

- **Subqueries and Nested Queries:**  
  - Utilized subqueries to perform multi-step analyses and filter data based on the results of other queries.

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**  
  - Used SQL functions and expressions to clean and transform data directly within queries, preparing it for further analysis.

## Lessons Learned

- **SQL as a Core Data Tool:**  
  SQL is essential for extracting and analyzing data from relational databases, a foundational skill for any data analyst or scientist.

- **Query Efficiency and Clarity:**  
  Writing clear, efficient queries is important for both performance and maintainability, especially when dealing with large datasets.

- **Combining Data Sources:**  
  Mastering joins and subqueries enables deeper analysis by leveraging relationships across multiple tables.

- **Iterative Problem Solving:**  
  Complex data questions are often answered through iterative querying—breaking down problems into manageable steps and building up to the final analysis.

## Conclusion

The SQL Mini Project provided practical experience with the core tools and techniques of SQL for data analysis. By working through real-world scenarios, I strengthened my ability to write effective queries, aggregate and join data, and extract actionable insights from relational databases—key competencies for data-driven problem solving.
