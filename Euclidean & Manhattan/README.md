# Euclidean and Manhattan Distances Case Study

## Overview

This project investigates two fundamental distance metrics—Euclidean and Manhattan distances—using hands-on analysis in a Jupyter notebook[1]. The case study demonstrates how these metrics are calculated, their mathematical properties, and their practical applications in data science and machine learning.

## Concepts Explored

- **Euclidean Distance:**
  - Measures the straight-line ("as the crow flies") distance between two points in space.
  - Commonly used in scenarios where direct geometric distance is meaningful, such as clustering and physical measurements[2][6][7].
  - Formula involves squaring differences, summing them, and taking the square root.

- **Manhattan Distance:**
  - Also known as city block or L1 distance, it sums the absolute differences between coordinates.
  - Useful when movement is restricted to grid-like paths (e.g., city streets, circuit boards) or in high-dimensional data where it can be computationally more efficient[2][3][5][6].
  - Formula is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates.

- **Comparison and Use Cases:**
  - The project compares both metrics on sample data, visualizing the differences and discussing when each is appropriate[2][6].
  - Manhattan distance is preferred in grid-based problems or when computational efficiency is critical, while Euclidean is suited for open, continuous spaces[2][3][6].
  - Discusses the impact of dimensionality, computational complexity, and the importance of feature scaling when applying these metrics in machine learning[3][6].

## Lessons Learned

- **Metric Choice Matters:**  
  The selection between Euclidean and Manhattan distance can significantly impact the results of algorithms like k-nearest neighbors and clustering. The best metric depends on the problem context, data geometry, and computational constraints[2][3][6].

- **Interpretability:**  
  Understanding the geometric intuition behind each distance metric helps in explaining model behavior and results.

- **Computational Considerations:**  
  Manhattan distance is computationally simpler (involving only addition and subtraction), which can be advantageous for large or high-dimensional datasets[6].

- **Feature Scaling:**  
  Both metrics can be sensitive to differences in scale among features, emphasizing the need for normalization or standardization in preprocessing[3][6].

## Conclusion

This case study provided practical experience with Euclidean and Manhattan distances, deepening my understanding of how and when to use each metric in data analysis and machine learning. The project reinforced the importance of metric selection in modeling and the need to consider both mathematical properties and real-world context when analyzing data[2][3][6].
