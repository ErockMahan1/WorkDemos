# API Data Wrangling Case Study

## Overview

This project demonstrates practical data wrangling techniques for working with data retrieved from APIs. Conducted in a Jupyter notebook, the case study walks through the process of fetching, cleaning, transforming, and preparing API data for analysis using Python and its popular libraries.

## Concepts Explored

* **API Data Extraction:**

  * Automated the process of fetching data from an external API using Python's `requests` library.
  * Converted the retrieved JSON data into a pandas DataFrame for further manipulation and analysis.

* **Data Cleaning:**

  * Removed duplicate records and handled missing values using pandas methods such as `drop_duplicates()` and `fillna()`.
  * Standardized column names and data formats to ensure consistency across the dataset.

* **Data Transformation:**

  * Applied transformations to create new features or modify existing ones, such as converting data types, aggregating values, or reshaping the data structure.
  * Used method chaining and reusable functions to streamline the wrangling process and improve code readability.

* **Encoding and Scaling:**

  * Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features to prepare the data for downstream analysis or modeling.

* **Automation and Efficiency:**

  * Automated repetitive data wrangling tasks with reusable functions and, for larger datasets, discussed the use of parallel processing libraries like Dask.
  * Emphasized best practices for efficient, reproducible data pipelines.

## Lessons Learned

* **End-to-End Workflow:**
  Wrangling API data involves not just extraction, but also thorough cleaning, transformation, and preparation for analysis or machine learning.

* **Reusability and Automation:**
  Encapsulating cleaning steps in functions and using method chaining or pipelines can save time and reduce errors, especially when working with multiple or frequently updated datasets.

* **Python Ecosystem:**
  Libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn provide powerful tools for every step of the data wrangling process, from data import to transformation and encoding.

* **Scalability:**
  For large or complex datasets, tools like Dask or workflow automation can improve efficiency and handle data at scale.

## Conclusion

This case study provided hands-on experience with API data wrangling in Python, covering the full pipeline from extraction to preparation for analysis. By leveraging automation and the robust Python data stack, I learned how to efficiently transform raw API data into a clean, structured format ready for analytics or machine learning tasks.
