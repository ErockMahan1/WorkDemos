# Statistical Inference

## Overview

This project explores foundational concepts in statistical inference using Python. It is part of the Springboard Data Science curriculum and is designed to build a practical understanding of how to draw conclusions about populations from samples. The work is organized into Jupyter notebooks and code files, following a hands-on, example-driven approach.

## Concepts Explored

* **Sampling and the Central Limit Theorem:**
  The project demonstrates how sample statistics can be used to make inferences about population parameters, and how the Central Limit Theorem underpins the reliability of these inferences.

* **Point and Interval Estimation:**
  Methods for estimating population means and proportions are covered, including the construction and interpretation of confidence intervals.

* **Hypothesis Testing:**
  The notebooks walk through the logic and implementation of hypothesis tests, including setting up null and alternative hypotheses, calculating test statistics, and interpreting p-values.

* **Simulation and Resampling:**
  The project makes use of computational techniques such as bootstrapping and permutation tests to reinforce theoretical concepts and provide intuition for sampling distributions.

* **Statistical Thinking in Python:**
  Practical skills are developed for performing statistical inference using libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and statsmodels.

## Lessons Learned

* **Importance of Sampling:**
  Understanding how samples are drawn and how sampling variability affects statistical conclusions is fundamental to sound inference.

* **Confidence Intervals vs. Point Estimates:**
  Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for population parameters, offering more information than single-point estimates.

* **Interpreting p-values and Significance:**
  The project reinforced the correct interpretation of p-values and the importance of considering both statistical and practical significance.

* **Simulation as a Learning Tool:**
  Using simulation and resampling methods helped solidify understanding of abstract concepts like the sampling distribution and the law of large numbers.

* **Critical Approach to Assumptions:**
  The exercises highlighted the necessity of checking assumptions (e.g., normality, independence) before applying classical inference methods.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I gained practical experience with the core tools and concepts of statistical inference. I learned how to estimate population parameters, test hypotheses, and use simulation to better understand statistical principles. The project has strengthened my ability to apply statistical thinking to real-world data analysis problems.
