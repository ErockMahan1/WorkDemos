# Regression Case Study – The Red Wine Dataset

## Overview

This project applies linear regression techniques to the Red Wine Quality dataset, a well-known dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The primary goal is to predict wine quality based on various physicochemical properties of red wine samples. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter notebook and follows a complete data science workflow, from exploratory data analysis to model evaluation.

## Concepts Explored

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualized distributions and relationships between wine features and quality.
  - Identified key variables that correlate with wine quality, such as alcohol content, volatile acidity, sulphates, and citric acid.

- **Feature Engineering and Selection:**
  - Assessed the impact of each chemical attribute on wine quality.
  - Selected features for modeling based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge.

- **Linear Regression Modeling:**
  - Built and interpreted multiple linear regression models to predict wine quality.
  - Explored both simple (single-feature) and multivariate regression approaches.
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as R², RMSE, and MAE.

- **Model Diagnostics and Interpretation:**
  - Analyzed residuals to check model assumptions.
  - Interpreted regression coefficients to understand the effect of each feature on predicted wine quality.
  - Compared linear regression with more advanced techniques (such as LASSO and Random Forests) to benchmark performance.

## Lessons Learned

- **Feature Importance:**  
  Alcohol content and sulphates tend to have a positive relationship with wine quality, while volatile acidity and total sulfur dioxide show negative associations. Not all features contribute equally, and some can even reduce model accuracy if included indiscriminately.

- **Limitations of Linear Regression:**  
  Linear models provide a useful baseline, but their predictive power is limited by the linearity assumption and the dataset’s class imbalance (most wines are rated as average quality). More complex models like Random Forests may yield better performance but can be harder to interpret.

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  It is important to use multiple evaluation metrics and cross-validation to assess model reliability and avoid overfitting.

- **Data Quality and Balance:**  
  The dataset’s imbalance (many wines of average quality) makes it challenging to distinguish high- and low-quality wines. Additional features or more balanced data could improve predictive accuracy.

- **Interpretability:**  
  Understanding and communicating the meaning of model coefficients and the influence of each feature is crucial for actionable insights in real-world applications.

## Conclusion

This case study provided practical experience with the end-to-end process of regression modeling in Python. By working with the Red Wine Quality dataset, I developed skills in EDA, feature selection, linear regression, and model evaluation. The project highlighted the strengths and limitations of linear regression for predicting wine quality and reinforced the importance of thoughtful feature selection, model diagnostics, and clear communication of results.
